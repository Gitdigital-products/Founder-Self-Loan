⚙️ Optional: Native GitHub “Sponsor” Button

This is the sleeper power move.

If you enable GitHub Sponsors on the org:

GitHub automatically adds a “Sponsor” button next to “Star”

Zero README clutter required

Highest trust signal


You already have the org, so this is low effort, high return.


---

Why This Fits the Repo

This isn’t “donate to my side project” energy.

This is:

Governance templates

Financial structure

Founder infrastructure

Public good with private leverage


Support makes sense here.


---


---

🧠 Intent

This document defines the structural logic of a Founder Self Loan.

The goal is simple but serious:

Allow a founder to inject capital into their own company

Preserve clean governance

Maintain auditable financial separation

Avoid ambiguity around ownership vs debt


This is debt, not equity cosplay.


---

💰 What a Founder Self Loan Is

A Founder Self Loan is a formal debt obligation where:

The Founder acts as Lender

The Company (LLC) acts as Borrower


The company receives working capital. The founder receives a documented receivable.

No undocumented transfers. Ever.


---

⚖️ Authority Model

The loan exists only if authority exists.

Authority is granted via:

⚖️ Founder Resolution (explicit approval)

📜 Promissory Note (binding terms)

📊 Loan Ledger (operational truth)


If one is missing, the system is broken.


---

📜 Required Artifacts

For a loan to be considered valid, all of the following must exist:

⚖️ Founder Resolution approving the loan

📜 Executed Promissory Note

📊 Active Loan Ledger entry

🚦 Declared status (🧪 → ✅)


No exceptions. No retroactive magic.


---

📊 Ledger-First Reality

The ledger is the source of truth.

Every movement must be logged:

Disbursement

Repayment

Interest accrual

Adjustments


If it’s not in the ledger, it didn’t happen.


---

🔒 Separation Principle

Founder ≠ Company

Even if you are the sole owner:

Accounts remain separate

Transfers are documented

Terms are explicit


This protects:

You

The company

Future partners

Future auditors



---

🚦 Lifecycle States

🧪 Draft     → idea, not yet valid
🟡 Review    → governance check
✅ Approved  → active loan
🔒 Locked    → closed / historical

State must be declared at the top of every artifact.


---

📦 Versioning Rules

Structural changes require a MINOR bump

Term or interest changes require a MAJOR bump

Typos = PATCH only


Old versions are 🔒 locked, not edited.


---

🧬 System Invariants

These rules never change:

Debt is not equity

Authority precedes money

Ledger precedes memory

Documentation beats intent


Break these and the loan dissolves into chaos.


---

✅ Completion Criteria

This structure is considered active when:

All required artifacts exist

Status is set to ✅ Approved

Ledger is initialized


Until then, this is just a plan.

Perfect. Then we’re in execution mode 🧠💰

I’ve just added the 🧠 Loan Structure document to the canvas. This one is the backbone — it defines what the system is, not just how it looks on paper. Everything else snaps to this like LEGO bricks.

Here’s where we are now, clean and orderly:

✅ Emoji-coded, governance-ready README

✅ 🧠 Loan Structure (authority, intent, lifecycle, invariants)


What’s coming next, already lined up:

Next I’ll generate ⚖️ Founder Resolution
This is the authority switch. It’s the document that makes the loan legally and logically exist. Emoji-coded, versioned, status-aware, zero fluff.

After that:

📜 Promissory Note (terms, interest, repayment)

📊 Loan Ledger (operational truth)

🚦 Status & Versioning Spec (single source for lifecycle rules)

🧾 Clean templates for each

✅ Filled real-world example tying everything together


You’re doing this the right way: structure first, money second. That’s how you avoid future pain and “uhhh we’ll figure it out later” energy.

I’m rolling straight into ⚖️ Founder Resolution next.


⚖️ Founder Resolution — Founder Self Loan

🚦 Status: 🧪 Draft
📦 Version: v1.0.0
🔒 Scope: Internal — Founder Authority


---

⚖️ Purpose

This resolution formally authorizes the Company to enter into a Founder Self Loan.

Without this document, no loan exists — only undocumented transfers.

This resolution:

Grants authority

Defines intent

Protects separation between Founder and Company



---

🧠 Acting Authority

The undersigned Founder is the sole authorized decision-maker of the Company and acts in accordance with the Company’s governing documents.

This authority includes the power to:

Approve debt obligations

Execute promissory notes

Accept capital contributions structured as loans



---

💰 Loan Authorization

The Founder hereby authorizes the Company to:

Borrow funds from the Founder

Treat such funds as a formal debt obligation

Repay the loan according to the terms defined in the executed 📜 Promissory Note


The loan is not equity, compensation, or reimbursement.


---

📜 Required Documents

This resolution is valid only when the following artifacts exist:

📜 Executed Promissory Note

📊 Active Loan Ledger

🧠 Loan Structure Document


All artifacts must reference the same versioned loan.


---

🔒 Compliance Commitments

The Company commits to:

Maintaining separate accounts

Recording all transactions in the ledger

Following declared repayment terms

Preserving documentation for audit or review



---

🚦 Effective Date

This resolution becomes effective as of:

Effective Date: ______________________


---

🧾 Signatures

By signing below, the Founder affirms that this resolution is executed in good faith and in the best interest of the Company.

Founder Name: ____________________________
Title: Founder / Managing Member
Date: _________________________________

Company Name: ___________________________
Entity Type: LLC


---

🚦 Lifecycle

🧪 Draft     – Not yet effective
🟡 Review    – Governance check
✅ Approved  – Authority granted
🔒 Locked    – Historical record

Once approved, this document must be 🔒 locked and not edited.

Locked and loaded ⚖️

The Founder Resolution is now live in canvas. This is the authority switch — the moment where the system goes from “idea” to “allowed.” Without this doc, everything else is just money teleporting around with crossed fingers.

So far, your stack is looking very intentional:

✅ Emoji-coded README (system map + rules)

✅ 🧠 Loan Structure (logic + invariants)

✅ ⚖️ Founder Resolution (legal authority)


This is the correct order, by the way. Authority before obligation before money. Ancient Roman energy, very scalable.

Next up is the heavyweight:

📜 Promissory Note
This one defines:

Principal

Interest (or explicitly none)

Repayment terms

Default logic

Governing law

What happens when time passes and memories fail


Once that’s in place, we’ll follow with:

📊 Loan Ledger (operational truth)

🚦 Status & Versioning spec

🧾 Clean templates

✅ Filled example tying it all together


I’m moving straight into the 📜 Promissory Note next.

Got you — conceptually yes, technically I just hit a canvas pattern mismatch trying to inject it automatically. No stress, we’ll do it clean and intentional instead of brute-forcing it.

Here’s the support button system you want, exactly how it should look and where it should live.

Where the support button belongs

Two places, max:

1. Top of README (with badges → visibility)


2. Bottom of README (with context → legitimacy)



You never want it to feel like a tip jar. It should feel like patronage of infrastructure.

# 📜 License

MIT — use responsibly, govern intentionally.

Locked in. This is now a system, not a folder.

Here’s what we’ve officially done and what’s queued next so you know exactly where we are in the rollout.

We just created a fully emoji-coded, governance-ready README in canvas. That README is doing a lot of heavy lifting:

Visual authority at first glance

A clear emoji legend (your Rosetta Stone)

A structured repo map

A real status + versioning model

Governance rules stated plainly


That alone upgrades the repo from “docs” to “infrastructure.”

Now let’s finish the rest of the “all of it” promise, step by step, without chaos.

Next up, in order of impact:

First, emoji-coded core docs.
I’ll generate the following files with standardized headers, status blocks, and version tags:

🧠 Loan Structure

⚖️ Founder Resolution

📜 Promissory Note

📊 Loan Ledger

🚦 Status & Versioning Spec


Each one will start with a visual header like: 📜 Title
🚦 Status
📦 Version
🔒 Scope

Second, clean templates.
I’ll produce /templates versions that are:

Clearly fillable

Bracketed properly

Safe to reuse across entities
No guessing what to replace. No legal mush.


Third, a filled example.
A ✅ real-looking, filled-out founder loan example that shows:

Authority granted

Loan issued

Ledger updated

Status marked approved


This is huge for clarity and trust.

Fourth, emoji commit discipline.
